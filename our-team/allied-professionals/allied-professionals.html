  <h2>Allied professionals</h2>
  <p>As well as the surgical team, the Centre couldn’t run without the help of our nursing staff, hand therapists and other allied health professionals.&nbsp; These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ward Nursing staff</strong> - with experience in Plastic Surgery nursing, Burns and ITU or paediatric specialisation as appropriate.</li>
	<li><strong>Therapists</strong> – our wards are covered by both general occupational and physiotherapists as well as having access to our specialised and word class hand therapists.</li>
	<li><strong>Dietetics</strong> – he have access to dieticians with training to manage patients with large surface area wounds often met in Plastic Surgery and in patients with burns.</li>
	<li><strong>Specialist Nurses </strong>– Our clinics are staffed by nursing staff with a thorough knowledge of Plastic Surgery and in particular wound care and dressings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, we have a team of clinical support nurses who manage the trauma and telemedicine clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp; Running independent clinics, our <strong>Burns Outreach</strong> and <strong>Complex Wound Senior Nurses</strong> provide an invaluable service to patients at UHSM and in the community.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have a dedicated <strong>Skin Cancer Specialist Nurse</strong> who is the primary contact and familiar face for our skin oncology patients.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sr. Julie Collins is also able to review skin cancer patients independently in clinic.</li>
	<li><strong>Clinical Psychology</strong> – Within the UHSM we have two Clinical Psychologists – one as part of the Burns MDT and the other managing Plastic Surgery patients.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a children’s psychologist as part of the team at RMCH, covering both Plastics and Burns.</li>
