Dietetics We have access to dieticians with training to manage patients with large surface area wounds often met in Plastic Surgery and in patients with burns. Specialist Nurses Our clinics are staffed by nursing staff with a thorough knowledge of Plastic Surgery and, in particular, wound care and dressings. Further, we have a team of clinical support nurses who manage the trauma and telemedicine clinics. Running independent clinics, our Burns Outreach and Complex Wound Senior Nurses provide an invaluable service to patients at UHSM and in the community. We also have a dedicated Skin Cancer Specialist Nurse who is the primary contact and familiar face for our skin oncology patients. Sr. Julie Collins is also able to review skin cancer patients independently in clinic. Clinical Psychology Within the UHSM we have two Clinical Psychologists – one as part of the Burns MDT and the other managing Plastic Surgery patients. There is a children’s psychologist as part of the team at RMCH, covering both Plastics and Burns.">
